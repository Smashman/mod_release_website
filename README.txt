This set of files easily provides download links for mod releases. It's designed for TF2, but I see no reason why it won't work with other Valve games.

The archive naming should be consistent with items packed with BANG's itemtoast (see your local Emporium OP for more).

Ensure you modify the settings within each mod release's index.php to make it work.

Thanks and have fun.
