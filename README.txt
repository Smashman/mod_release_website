//Created by Smashman - Version 1.1

This set of files easily provides download links for mod releases. It's designed for TF2, but I see no reason why it won't work with other Valve games.

To get the latest version, download https://github.com/Smashman/mod_release_website/archive/master.zip

The archive naming should be consistent with items packed with BANG's itemtoast (see your local Emporium OP for more).

To set up a page for a mod release, simply create a new folder, in the same location as "release_hat_folder". This can be named anything.

Copy the index.php from "release_hat_folder" into your newly created folder and modify the config settings to represent your new release.

Then create an "archives" folder within your new folder and populate it with your release files.

Ensure you delete the schema files when releasing a new mod. These are found in your main folder.

You can alter the style by modifying main/style.css.

If you want to report a bug or ask for any help, configuring or styling, feel free to add me on Steam.
